# Image Capture

## Background

Photosensitive pixels ("pixel element") constitute the silicon sensor of a digital camera. Sampling occurs spatially depending on the camera's angle of view, tonally depending on tones of brightness, and over time by controlling for exposure of a given duration. Photons are converted into photoelectrons via the photoelectric effect. Electrons are released and stored in a potential well during exposure proportional to the number of photons that hit the sensor. The electric charge accumulates and is converted to analog voltage and then digitized via an analog-to-digital converter. 

The ISO rating for an exposure describe the light sensitivity analogous to film's speed rating.
